## Drug use in Europe.
##### Drugs are fun and dangerous at the same time. Different kind of drugs are used all around the world. This project tries to visualize the drug use all over Europe and in the European countries. Besides that it tries to see if there is a correlation between assumed influences on drug use and drug use itself.
##### With a choropleth map of Europe is visualized how the drug use is distributed over Europe. The drugs are separated in six different groups. Furthermore there can be looked at the ratios of the drug use between the different drugs in one country. It looks as followed:

Same as with the choropleth map there can be looked at the ratios of the drug use between different drugs in one country. It looks as followed:
